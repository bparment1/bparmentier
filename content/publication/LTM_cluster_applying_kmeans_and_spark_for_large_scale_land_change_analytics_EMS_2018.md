abstract = "This study introduces a novel framework for land change simulation that combines the traditional Land
Transformation Model (LTM) with data clustering tools for the purposes of conducting land change simulations
of large areas (e.g., continental scale) and over multiple time steps. This framework, called “LTM-cluster”,
subsets massive land use datasets which are presented to the artificial neural network-based LTM. LTM-cluster
uses the k-means clustering algorithm implemented within the Spark high-performance compute environment.
To illustrate the framework, we use three case studies in the United States which vary in simulation extents, cell
size, time intervals, number of inputs, and quantity of urban change. Findings indicate consistent and substantial
improvements in accuracy performance for all three case studies compared to the traditional LTM model im-
plemented without input clustering. Specifically, the percent correct match, the area under the operating
characteristics curve, and the error rate improved on average of 9%, 11%, and 4%. These results confirm that
LTM-cluster has high reliability when handling large datasets. Future studies should expand on the framework
by exploring other clustering methods and algorithms."
